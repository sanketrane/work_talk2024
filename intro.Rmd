- Inside an immune response the possible number of combinations that can arise starting from same initial conditions is pretty large

- most dont start from same init conds

## Understand the rules governing the <br> variability in our responses to diseases


???

But we conjecture --

Similar to how a simple set of rules on the chess board can result in an enormous number of possible game positions,

Something similar operates for our immune system
And if such a system of rules exist the we hope to explore and understand them

Why do our immune systems produce distinct outcomes in similar disease contexts?

Immune variability is not a new concept. 
Immunologists have long pondered why our immune systems produce distinct outcomes in similar disease scenarios.

There is variation within and among populations.

For example, certain vaccines provide lifelong protection, while others require frequent boosters?

We began with a simple question 

When cell populations are selected using a population defining marker -- that is uniquely expressed on them, such as CD4 for CD4 T cells -- does the variability in that proxy marker have any meaning at all?

### Heterogeneity in T cells
<hr>

Co-receptor (CD4 and CD8) <span style="color:#E37383;">Low</span> naive T cells:


  - Respond poorly to stimulation &mdash;
    - Weaker activation and proliferation than co-receptor <span style="color:#638E64;">High</span> cells.
    
    
???
to answer this, I sorted the high and low expressing naive T cells for a bunch of protein markers e.g. CD4, CD8, PD1, TCR, etc. 
We indeed found that for several of these markers the variability in expression meant variability in phenotypic and functional properties of naive T cells. 


--

  - Show a distinct phenotype as compared to co-receptor <span style="color:#638E64;">High</span> cells &mdash;

This was back when I was an experimental immunologist and was focusing on naive T cells

To answer this -- I sorted the high and low naive T cells for a bunch of protein markers e.g. CD4, CD8, PD1, TCR, etc. 

For Several of these markers the variability in expression meant variability in phenotype and functional properties of naive T cells. 

Strongest effects  for CD4 and CD8 co-receptors 
- co-receptor low cells showed poor responsiveness as compared to high cells and they also had a distinct phenotype. 
expressed high amounts of senescent markers and essentially resembled T cells from old individuals.

Over time, majority of co-receptor low cells persisted as low while, high cells lost their CD4/CD8 expression and became low cells, representing the cellular aging process.

We concluded that the Heterogeneity T cell responsiveness is basically linked to the time that they spend in circulation.

The high-level idea is 

Variation in cellular-states such as 

- young or old cells 

- particular expression signature

- cells with varying division histories


Of course alternative or null hypothesis is  pure randomness.
